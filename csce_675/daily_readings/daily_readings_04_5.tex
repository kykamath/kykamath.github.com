\section{Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios,
Societies (5S): A Formal Model for Digital
Libraries
\cite{marcos:5s}}
\noindent Details:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Year: 2004
  \item Type: ACM Trans. Inf. Syst
  \item Affiliations: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Take-away points: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item This paper gives formal models for digital libraries.
  \item  The authors give fundamental abstractions of Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, and Societies (5S), which allows them to deﬁne digital libraries rigorously.
  \item  The applicability, versatility, and unifying power of the 5S model are demonstrated through its use in three distinct applications: building and interpretation of a DL taxonomy, informal and formal analysis of case studies of digital libraries (NDLTD and OAI), and utilization as a formal basis for a DL description language.
\end{itemize}
